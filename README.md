Running the simulations using the computational tissue model

Steps to run the simulations are provided here.

Prerequisites:

- Ensure you have the latest version of MATLAB installed.

Instructions:

1. Download the code.

2. Open the code: Open "model20250710.m" for running the simulations.

3. The code is annotated for better understanding and ease of use.

4. In MATLAB, click on Run (or alternatively press F5 on the keyboard).


Files Included:
